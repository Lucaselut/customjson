# CustomJSON

CustomJSON is a Python library designed to enhance the manipulation of JSON-like data structures. It provides an intuitive interface for working with dictionaries, offering convenient features to streamline common operations.

## Key Features

- **File Loading:** Easily load JSON data from a file or initialize a dictionary directly.
- **Dynamic String Representation:** Obtain a dynamic string representation for easy inspection of the dictionary.
- **Attribute-Like Access:** Access and modify values using attribute-like syntax for improved code readability.
- **Element Removal:** Efficiently remove dictionary elements using the subtraction operator (`-=`) with either a single key or a list of keys.
- **Dynamic Attribute Addition:** Add new attributes to the dictionary dynamically.
- **Bulk Operations:** Perform bulk operations like addition and subtraction with lists for efficient updates.

## Usage Example

```python
import customjson
from customjson import json

# Load data from a file or initialize a dictionary
dict_data = json('test.json')

# Access and modify values using attribute-like syntax
dict_data.value = 2

# Remove elements using subtraction operator
dict_data -= "value"

# Delete a specific attribute
del dict_data.number

# Accessing a non-existent attribute returns None
value_x = dict_data.x

# Perform bulk operations with a list
dict_data += [str(i) for i in range(5)]

# Remove multiple elements in one go
dict_data -= [str(i) for i in range(5)]
```
